# config
After a redump or to get a clean repo @school

```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCorazza/config/non-osX-env/redump.sh | sh ```

To do when brew gets fixed :
- [x] reinstall Node and npm
- [ ] reinstall ionic
- [ ] make courses

Global To-DO
- [ ] ```ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc``` or vimrc in .vim directory ? (*doc unclear*)
- [ ] Add options (```if```) typical config files are present or absent.
- [ ] Add y/n choices for different options (update vim, install Node or Ionic, ...)
- [x] test the shit out of this script
- [ ] for the non-osX-env, ```apt-get install tig git vim curl zsh -y``` (think of other things to install)
- [ ] for the non-osX-env, ```apt-get update``` ```apt-get upgrade```
- [ ] try to think of other needed features
- [ ] for the non-osX-env, LF the config file for term colors and add it with config colors
